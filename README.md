# Vehicle Builder CLI

## Description
The Vehicle Builder CLI is a command-line application that allows users to create, manage, and interact with different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. Users can perform various actions with these vehicles, such as accelerating, decelerating, turning, and even performing specialized actions like towing (for trucks) or wheelies (for motorbikes).

This project is implemented using TypeScript and follows an object-oriented approach to define vehicle classes and their behaviors. It leverages the `inquirer` package for user input and provides a seamless interactive experience.

## Features
- **Vehicle Creation**: Users can create new vehicles of type Car, Truck, or Motorbike by entering relevant details.
- **Vehicle Management**: Select and manage existing vehicles to perform actions.
- **Specialized Actions**:
  - Trucks: Tow other vehicles.
  - Motorbikes: Perform wheelies.
- **Dynamic VIN Generation**: Automatically generate unique VINs for all vehicles.
- **Reusable Components**: Includes modular class definitions for Cars, Trucks, Motorbikes, and Wheels.

---

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing and enhanced development experience.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing the application.
- **Inquirer.js**: Handles user input through an interactive command-line interface.
